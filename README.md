# Student Satisfaction Survey â€” Power BI Dashboard

## 
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project presents a Power BI dashboard designed to analyze student satisfaction survey results, covering 8,300 responses across 29 courses and 20 questions.

The dashboard consolidates key performance indicators (KPIs), rating distributions, and course/question-level insights into an interactive report. It enables faculty and administrators to:

Monitor overall feedback participation rates
